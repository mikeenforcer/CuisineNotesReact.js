      <h1>Indian Cuisine</h1>
      <p>
        Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional
        cuisines native to India. Given the diversity in soil, climate, culture,
        ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially and
        use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits. Indian food
        is also heavily influenced by religion, in particular Hinduism and
        Islam, cultural choices and traditions.[1][2] Historical events such as
        invasions, trade relations, and colonialism have played a role in
        introducing certain foods to this country. The Columbian discovery of
        the New World brought a number of new vegetables and fruit to India. A
        number of these such as potatoes, tomatoes, chillies, peanuts, and guava
        have become staples in many regions of India.
