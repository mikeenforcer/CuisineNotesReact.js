      <p>
        Mexican cuisine consists of the cooking cuisines and traditions of the
        modern country of Mexico. Its earliest roots lie in Mesoamerican
        cuisine. Its ingredients and methods begin with the first agricultural
        communities such as the Olmec and Maya who domesticated maize, created
        the standard process of nixtamalization, and established their
        foodways.[2] Successive waves of other Mesoamerican groups brought with
        them their own cooking methods. These included: the Teotihuacanos,
        Toltec, Huastec, Zapotec, Mixtec, Otomi, Pur√©pecha, Totonac, Mazatec,
        Mazahua, and Nahua. With the Mexica formation of the multi-ethnic Triple
        Alliance (Aztec Empire), culinary foodways became infused (Aztec
        cuisine).
