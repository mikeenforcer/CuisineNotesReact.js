      <h1>Chinese Cuisine</h1>
      <p>
        Chinese cuisine encompasses the numerous cuisines originating from
        China, as well as overseas cuisines created by the Chinese diaspora.
        Because of the Chinese diaspora and historical power of the country,
        Chinese cuisine has influenced many other cuisines in Asia and beyond,
        with modifications made to cater to local palates. Chinese food staples
        such as rice, soy sauce, noodles, tea, chili oil, and tofu, and utensils
        such as chopsticks and the wok, can now be found worldwide. The
        preferences for seasoning and cooking techniques of Chinese provinces
        depend on differences in social class, religion, historical background,
        and ethnic groups. Geographic features including mountains, rivers,
        forests, and deserts also have a strong effect on the local available
        ingredients, considering that the climate of China varies from tropical
        in the south to subarctic in the northeast. Imperial royal and noble
        preference also plays a role in the change of Chinese cuisine. Because
        of imperial expansion and trading, ingredients and cooking techniques
        from other cultures have been integrated into Chinese cuisines over
        time.
