      <p>
        Italian cuisine (Italian: cucina italiana, pronounced [kuˈtʃiːna
        itaˈljaːna]) is a Mediterranean cuisine[1] consisting of the
        ingredients, recipes and cooking techniques developed across the Italian
        Peninsula and later spread around the world together with waves of
        Italian diaspora.[2][3][4] Some of these foods were imported from other
        cultures. Significant changes occurred with the colonization of the
        Americas and the introduction of potatoes, tomatoes, capsicums, maize
        and sugar beet — the latter introduced in quantity in the 18th
        century.[5][6] It is one of the best-known and most appreciated
        gastronomies worldwide.
